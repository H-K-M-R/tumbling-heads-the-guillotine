		<p align= "center">		What was one of the worst ways in history to die? Some may argue it was the guillotine, although supposedly painless. What was the creation of the guillotine like? How did it change the world?</p>

		<h1 align= "center">Before the Guillotine</h1>
	
		<p align= "center">		Before the guillotine was invented, the punishment in France wasn’t fair. If you were rich or powerful, you got beheaded with a sword or an axe. This was a particularly effective way to be executed, since it wasn’t painful like some other ways. These painful ways were how peasants were executed, most commonly they were hung which can be very painful because you get strangled and can’t breathe, or your neck will get snapped.</p>

		<h1 align= "center">The Creator of the Guillotine</h1>
		
		<p align= "center">		The guillotine was named afer the French physician, Joseph Ignace Guillotin, who is shown in a painting below, who was born in 1738, dying peacefully in 1814.<p/>

		<p align= "center">		Although the device was named after Guillotin, he only had the idea for the guillotine, and did not create it. The true creators of the guillotine were Dr. Antoine Louis, the designer, and Tobias Schmidt, it's builder. The first man killed by the guillotine was Nicolas Jacques Pelletier, a notorious highwayman.</p>

		<p align= "center">		The falling blade of a guillotine has a rate of approximetely 21 feet per second. Guillotine blades reach this speed because there is an attached rope, and that means the blade will be pulled down more by gravity since the rope is holding it up and is suddenly let go of.</p>

		<h1  align= "center" style="color: rgb(184, 15, 10)">Death Toll</h1>

		<p  align= "center">		Over 40,000 people died by guillotine within the first decade of its use. The vast majority were common people. Some of the most famous deaths were that of Marie Antoinette and King Louis XVI, pictured below.</p>

		<p align= "center"> The final use of the guillotine was in 1977, Marseille, France. The name of the executed man was Hamida Djandoubi, who was a Tunisian immagrant convicted of murder. The last <em>public</em> use of the guillotine, however, was in 1939. The criminal was Eugen Weidmann, who had kidnapped and killed at least six people, some being rich tourists. The crowd was in hysterics at this, and the French government, the flag of which is depicted below, ordered that executions must be private.</p>

		<p align= "center">Before 1939, all executions were public. An example is painted below.</p>

		<h1 align= "center">After the Guillotine</h1>

		<p align= "center">The guillotine didn't just affect France. I was also used in Nazi Germany as an execution method. Little guillotines were quite the popular children's toy in the 1790s. Children could decapitate dolls and small rodents with the two foot tall replica. There's a exhibit about the guillotine in Paris, France, honoring its legacy. The guillotine was a symbol in France representing the Reign of Terror, and it no longer being used shows how France has entered a more peaceful era.</p>
